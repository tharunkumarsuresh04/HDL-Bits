/*
Now that you know how to build a full adder, make 3 instances of it to create a 3-bit binary ripple-carry adder. 
The adder adds two 3-bit numbers and a carry-in to produce a 3-bit sum and carry out. To encourage you to actually instantiate full adders, also output the carry-out from each full adder in the ripple-carry adder. 
cout[2] is the final carry-out from the last full adder, and is the carry-out you usually see.
