/*
For the following Karnaugh map, give the circuit implementation using one 4-to-1 multiplexer and as many 2-to-1 multiplexers as required, but using as few as possible. 
You are not allowed to use any other logic gate and you must use a and b as the multiplexer selector inputs, as shown on the 4-to-1 multiplexer below.

You are implementing just the portion labelled top_module, such that the entire circuit (including the 4-to-1 mux) implements the K-map.

(The requirement to use only 2-to-1 multiplexers exists because the original exam question also wanted to test logic function simplification using K-maps and how to synthesize logic functions using only multiplexers. 
If you wish to treat this as purely a Verilog exercise, you may ignore this constraint and write the module any way you wish.)
