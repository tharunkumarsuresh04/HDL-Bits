/*
Create a 100-bit binary ripple-carry adder by instantiating 100 full adders. The adder adds two 100-bit numbers and a carry-in to produce a 100-bit sum and carry out. 
To encourage you to actually instantiate full adders, also output the carry-out from each full adder in the ripple-carry adder. 
cout[99] is the final carry-out from the last full adder, and is the carry-out you usually see.
