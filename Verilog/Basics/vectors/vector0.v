/* Vectors are used to group related signals using one name to make it more convenient to manipulate. For example, wire [7:0] w; declares an 8-bit vector named w that is functionally equivalent to having 8 separate wires.

Notice that the declaration of a vector places the dimensions before the name of the vector, which is unusual compared to C syntax. However, the part select has the dimensions after the vector name as you would expect.


wire [99:0] my_vector;      // Declare a 100-element vector
assign out = my_vector[10]; // Part-select one bit out of the vector

Build a circuit that has one 3-bit input, then outputs the same vector, and also splits it into three separate 1-bit outputs. Connect output o0 to the input vector's position 0, o1 to position 1, etc.

In a diagram, a tick mark with a number next to it indicates the width of the vector (or "bus"), rather than drawing a separate line for each bit in the vector.*/

module top_module ( 
    input wire [2:0] vec,
    output wire [2:0] outv,
    output wire o2,
    output wire o1,
    output wire o0  ); // Module body starts after module declaration

    assign outv = vec;
    assign o2 = vec[2];
    assign o1 = vec[1];
    assign o0 = vec[0];
    
endmodule
